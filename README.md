# DeduplicationModel
This project creates a Python-based tool for efficient data deduplication in CSV files. It uses a custom key-based deduplication algorithm, allowing users to specify columns for duplicate detection. The tool enhances data quality, optimizes storage, and supports better decision-making with logging, error handling, and progress tracking.
